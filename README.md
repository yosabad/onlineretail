## Online Retail Dataset

RFM is a model used in marketing analysis that segments a company’s consumer base by their purchasing patterns or habits. RFM is used to identify a company’s or an organization’s best customers by measuring and analyzing spending habits to improve low-scoring customers and maintain high-scoring ones.
The RFM model is based on three quantitative factors:
- Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase
- Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase
- Monetary value: How much money a customer spends on purchases

This project is intended to analyze all transactions using RFM to segmentize the customers using KMeans.
